ðŸŒ¸ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier â€“ Iris Dataset
ðŸ“Œ Objective
Implement and understand the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for classification, visualize decision boundaries, and evaluate model performance.

ðŸ§° Tools Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Scikit-learn (KNeighborsClassifier, train_test_split, accuracy_score)

ðŸ“Š Task Overview
Loaded the Iris dataset (CSV format).

Normalized features using StandardScaler.

Built a KNN classifier using different values of K.

Evaluated performance with accuracy and confusion matrix.

Visualized decision boundaries using petal features.

âœ… Outcome
Best accuracy achieved at K = 6.

Clear visual separation of classes using petal-based features.

KNN is intuitive but sensitive to scaling and value of K.
